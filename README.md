//How to run the project locally (through xammp)

*Install free local server host --> https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
*After installing xammp you should make sure there aren't any other host users ( VPNS )
*After you disable all other apps that needed to be disabled you can run xampp
*There should be a button with Apache on it, and next to it should be button start ( Press it )
*Once Start button turns green you can go to "ThisPC->LocalDisk(C)->xampp->htdocs" and in there you should place all the files
*After that navigate yourself to any browser you are using and type "http://localhost/MageBit"
